@article{Durner.1994,
 abstract = {Errors in conductivity estimations can arise either from an invalidity of the prediction model for a given soil, or from an incorrect description of the retention data. This second error source is particularly important for soils with heterogeneous pore systems that cannot be adequately described by the usually used retention functions. To describe the retention characteristics of such soils, a flexible \textgreek{j}(\textgreek{y}) function was formed by superimposing unimodal retention curves of the van Genuchten (1980) type. By combining this retention model with the conductivity prediction model of Mualem (1976), conductivity estimations for soils with heterogeneous pore systems are obtained. Estimated conductivities by this model and the classical van Genuchten-Mualem method can differ by orders of magnitude. Thus reported disagreements between measured and estimated conductivities may in some cases be due to an inadequate description of the retention data rather than due to a failure of the prediction model. -from Author},

abstract = {Abstract Selecting a “best” model among several competing candidate models poses an often encountered problem in water resources modeling (and other disciplines which employ models). For a modeler, the best model fulfills a certain purpose best (e.g., flood prediction), which is typically assessed by comparing model simulations to data (e.g., stream flow). Model selection methods find the “best” trade-off between good fit with data and model complexity. In this context, the interpretations of model complexity implied by different model selection methods are crucial, because they represent different underlying goals of modeling. Over the last decades, numerous model selection criteria have been proposed, but modelers who primarily want to apply a model selection criterion often face a lack of guidance for choosing the right criterion that matches their goal. We propose a classification scheme for model selection criteria that helps to find the right criterion for a specific goal, i.e., which employs the correct complexity interpretation. We identify four model selection classes which seek to achieve high predictive density, low predictive error, high model probability, or shortest compression of data. These goals can be achieved by following either nonconsistent or consistent model selection and by either incorporating a Bayesian parameter prior or not. We allocate commonly used criteria to these four classes, analyze how they represent model complexity and what this means for the model selection task. Finally, we provide guidance on choosing the right type of criteria for specific model selection tasks. (A quick guide through all key points is given at the end of the introduction.)},

@article{Kosugi.1996,
 abstract = {The soil water retention model developed by Kosugi was modified to be compatible with Mualem's model in order to derive an analytical expression for the relative hydraulic conductivity K(r). The modified water retention model is to be derived by applying a lognormal distribution law to the soil pore radius distribution function. Parameters of this retention model have physical significance on the water content (\textgreek{j}) - capillary pressure (\textgreek{y}) curve and are related directly to the statistics of the pore radius distribution. The accuracy of the resulting combined water-retention- hydraulic-conductivity model is verified for observed data sets for six soils. Results showed that the proposed model produces acceptable matches with observed water retention curves and adequate predictions of hydraulic conductivities in five out of six cases. The \textgreek{j} - \textgreek{y} and K(r) - \textgreek{y} (or K(r) - \textgreek{j}) curves generated by this model are generally similar to those generated by van Genuchten's model.},

It uses a modified assumption concerning the hydraulic conductivity of the pore sequence in order to take into account the effect of the larger pore section. A computational method is derived for the determination of the residual water content and for the extrapolation of the water content-capillary head curve as measured in a limited range.},

 abstract = {There is a common need for reliable hydropedological information in Europe. In the last decades research institutes, universities and government agencies have developed local, regional and national datasets containing soil physical, chemical, hydrological and taxonomic information often combined with land use and landform data. A hydrological database for western European soils was also created in the mid-1990s. However, a comprehensive European hydropedological database, with possible additional information on chemical parameters and land use is still missing. A comprehensive joint European hydropedological inventory can serve multiple purposes, including scientific research, modelling and application of models on different geographical scales. The objective of the joint effort of the participants is to establish the European Hydropedological Data Inventory (EU-HYDI). This database holds data from European soils focusing on soil physical, chemical and hydrological properties. It also contains information on geographical location, soil classification and land use/cover at the time of sampling. It was assembled with the aim of encompassing the soil variability in Europe. It contains data from 18 countries with contributions from 29 institutions. This report presents an overview of the database, details the individual contributed datasets and explains the quality assurance and harmonization process that lead to the final database.},
