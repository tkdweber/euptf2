\title{Table of suggested PTF given the available predictor variables and target variable}
\format{
A data table with 32 rows and 10 variables
\itemize{
  \item Predictor_variables: combination of predictor variables
  \item THS: Water content at saturation, as measured soil water content at a pressure head of 0 cm.
  \item FC_2: Field capacity, as the measured soil water content at a pressure head of 330 cm.
  \item FC_2: Field capacity, as the measured soil water content at a pressure head of 100 cm.
  \item WP: Wilting point as the measured soil water content at a pressure head of 15000 cm.
  \item AWC_2: Available water content as the difference in soil water content between FC_2 and WP.
  \item AWC: Available water content as the difference in soil water content between FC and WP.
  \item KS: Saturated hydraulic conductivity.
  \item VG: van-Genuchten model parameters (\insertCite{vanGenuchten.1980}{euptf2}).
